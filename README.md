As part of my Applied Machine Learning module at university, I completed a project focused on predicting flight delays using classification algorithms. The models implemented included Logistic Regression, LightGBM, and XGBoost. This work was awarded a first-class.

### Abstract
Flight delays pose significant challenges to airlines, airports, and passengers resulting in economic losses and widespread
inconvenience. This study aims to predict flight delays using various classification methods including Logistic Regression,
LightGBM, and XGBoost. The hyperparameters of these methods were meticulously tuned, and their performance was
evaluated by using metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score and Accuracy. The models were trained on an openly available
flight database covering the period of January to July 2022. The results indicate that the LightGBM method was the most
effective in predicting flight delays. However, further experimentation with the methodology and the inclusion of additional
data, ideally covering more months, is necessary to validate this conclusion.
